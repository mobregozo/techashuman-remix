As engineers, decision-making is a crucial part of our work. Before making significant choices, we carefully analyze the potential advantages and disadvantages, aiming to avoid mistakes and errors.

By considering all factors and evaluating them, we struggle to reach a well-informed compromise. This process of assessing possible outcomes, although known by different names and using various tools, ultimately boils down to analyzing the situation and its context.

## **Embracing the lessons of regret**

Over time, I've noticed a recurring theme in this decision-making process: regret.

Living with regret is a common human experience, often born from looking back in retrospect. It's easy to think, "I should have chosen differently."

Drawing from these experiences of regret, I've embarked on a journey of understanding and self-reflection, learning how to live without regret and avoid judging past decisions. At the time I made those choices, I strongly believed they were the right ones. Instead of focusing on regrets, I now see mistakes as valuable lessons, allowing me to grow and prevent their recurrence, particularly when it comes to assumptions.

However, it's important to acknowledge the impossibility of predicting the future. Instead of aiming for perfection, let's pursue continual improvement and personal growth.

## **Embracing change and reflect**

In our ever-evolving lives, constant and rapid changes shape our view of past decisions. These changes go beyond the environments we live in, including unforeseen historical events and milestones.

Furthermore, we personally develop and adapt based on these contexts and circumstances. Unprecedented life events teach us to be more aware and appreciate the simple joys that life offers.

Even within our careers, I recall making job switches driven by the desire to collaborate with knowledgeable individuals and improve my technical skills as an engineer. I believed and confirmed that immersing myself in such an environment would lead to significant growth in these areas.

Yet, as time passed, trade-offs and the pros and cons transformed. I gained a deeper understanding of the effort required to push the boundaries of technology and the demands of staying at the cutting edge. As a result, I shifted my focus toward other important aspects, such as creating a harmonious work-life balance and leaving a positive mark on my work experiences.

In this constant state of change, we, as the managers of our own lives, continuously reassess our priorities. The results of past analyses may yield different outcomes after a year or longer, reminding us to be adaptable and open to change.

Remember, the journey of our lives is not fixed. It is through embracing change, reflecting on past experiences, and adjusting the compromises that we navigate the ever-changing path before us.
