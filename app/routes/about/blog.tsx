        I'm a software engineer and tech writer passionate about the
        intersection of technology and human life. This blog was born out of my
        love for exploring how tech shapes the world we live in. Through Tech as
        Human, I share my reflections on software development, product
        management, and the ethical implications of tech.

        From journaling to blogging
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        What started as a personal journaling exercise, recommended by my
        therapist in 2020, quickly evolved into a blog. My goal was simple:
        learn new technologies while sharing what I learned. Over time, this
        blog has turned into a place where I reflect on my journey and the tools
        that shape the tech industry.

        The Tech behind Tech as Human
      </h2>
      <p>
        The website has gone through different iterations, as I experimented
        with various static frameworks. I started with Nuxt.js, moved to
        Next.js, and eventually landed on Remix.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-8 mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Why Remix?</h3>
      <p>
        Remix stood out because it challenges conventional web development
        patterns and allows for flexible deployments without being tied to a
        specific hosting company.
      </p>
      <p>
        It provides an abstraction that reduces the need for boilerplate code
        while still giving me decent control over what's happening underneath.
        From dynamic content to cache control, I can easily customize how
        different aspects behave to suit the needs of this particular website.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-8 mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Content management</h3>
      <p>
        Initially, I experimented with different methods of managing my content,
        including static JSON files, Markdown, and Prismic (online CRM).
        However, I settled on Notion for its portability and flexibility. I love
        how Notion's API allows me to structure posts exactly as I want them,
        making the content creation process easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also use Unsplash to add images to each post. These images help
        visually represent the ideas and themes I am sharing.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-8 mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">
        Using Bluesky to manage comments
      </h3>
      <p>
        I use Bluesky to manage comments on the blog. It's a decentralized
        commenting system that allows readers to engage with the content without
        compromising their privacy.
      </p>

          adding comments.

      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-8 mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Why Plausible?</h3>
      <p>
        I use Plausible for analytics because it prioritizes privacy, offering a
        simple and clean interface. Plus, I love that it doesn't track personal
        data. The dashboard gives me a clear picture of how the blog is
        performing, and it's open for everyone to see. Here's a link to my{' '}

      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-8 mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Why Tailwind?</h3>
      <p>
        I use Tailwind CSS for its speed and flexibility. While it's not pure
        CSS, it makes my development process much faster and easier. I
        appreciate the utility-first approach, which allows me to make quick
        changes without diving into complex CSS rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the complexity of the website and the fact that I am working solo,
        Tailwind CSS is a perfect fit. It saves me from worrying about class
        names, BEM conventions, or other scalable CSS patterns, allowing me to
        focus more on building features and improving the user experience.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-8 mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Using Copilot and OpenAI</h3>
      <p>
        To speed up the development process, I've integrated GitHub Copilot for
        boilerplate code generation. It's a time-saver! For writing, I also rely
        on OpenAI tools to refine and enhance my content.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-8 mb-2 text-2xl font-bold">Why Substack?</h3>
      <p>
        Substack allows me to syndicate my blog content to a wider audience,
        helping me stay connected with readers through email newsletters. While
        organic traffic is valuable, Substack makes it easier to expand my reach
        and build a community around my content.

      <p>
        As I continue to experiment and iterate with new tools, I'll keep
        learning and sharing insights with you. This blog is not just about
        techâ€”it's about how technology intersects with our human experience. I
